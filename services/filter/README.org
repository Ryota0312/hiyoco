* Filter

  Edit event received with gRPC, and send event by gRPC．

** Installation

   Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

   #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
     gem 'filter'
   #+END_SRC

   And then execute:

   #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
     $ bundle
   #+END_SRC

   Or install it yourself as:

   #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
     $ gem install filter
   #+END_SRC

** Usage

   TODO: Write usage instructions here

** Development

   After checking out the repo,

   1. Install dependencies:
     #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
     $ cd filter
     $ bundle install --path=vendor/bundle --binstubs=bin
     #+END_SRC

   2. Generate gRPC code:
     #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
     $ bundle exec rake compile
     #+END_SRC

   To install this gem onto your local machine, run
   =bundle exec rake install=. To release a new version,
   update the version number in
   =version.rb=, and then run =bundle exec rake release=, which will
   create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push
   the =.gem= file to [[https://rubygems.org][rubygems.org]].
   You don’t need to run =bundle exec rake compile= before running
   =bundle exec rake install= or =bundle exec rake release= because
   both of commands are dependencies of =bundle exec rake compile=.
